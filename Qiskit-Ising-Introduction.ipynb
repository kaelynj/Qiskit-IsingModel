We then build a circuit which diagonalizes the Ising Hamiltonian so as to map each of the computational basis states of a quantum computer with the eigenstates of the system."

    "## Jordan-Wigner Transform <a id='jw-transform'></a>\n",
    "To utilize quantum computing when simulating Hubbard-like systems, one needs to first transform the Hubbard Hamiltonian into a set of operations accessible to quantum computers.  Namely, we use the Jordan-Wigner transformation to map the creation and annihilation operators of the Hubbard Hamiltonian to a set of Pauli matrices.  Traditionally, the Hubbard Hamiltonian in second quantization utilize creation and annihilation operators $\\hat{c}_{j,\\sigma}$ and $\\hat{c}_{j,\\sigma}^\\dagger$ which changes the occupation of a given spin orbital, as described above.  In a quantum computing environment, we map each fermionic mode (a given site with a given spin) to a single qubit.  Since we are now indexing by mode, we then drop the spin index and sum over the fermionic modes with the action of each operator being $\\hat{c}_{j}^\\dagger\\ket{0}_{j} = \\ket{1}_{j}$,  $\\hat{c}_{j}\\ket{1}_{j} = \\ket{0}_{j}$, $\\hat{c}^\\dagger_{j}\\ket{1}_{j}=0$, and $\\hat{c}_{j}\\ket{0}_{j}=0$ for each fermionic mode $j$.  It is straightforward to write their matrix representation in terms of the Pauli matrices\n",
    "\\begin{align}\n",
    "    \\hat{c}_{j}^\\dagger = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 0 \\\\ 1 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{X_{j} - iY_{j}}{2} \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "    \\hat{c}_{j} = \\begin{pmatrix} 0 & 1 \\\\ 0 & 0 \\end{pmatrix} = \\frac{X_{j} + iY_{j}}{2}\n",
    "    \\label{eq:c-cdagger}\n",
    "\\end{align}\n",
    "where $X_{j}$, $Y_{j}$ are the associated Pauli operators acting on the j$^{th}$ mode.  However, this mapping does not account for the antisymmetric characteristics of fermions.  We know that $\\hat{c}_{j}$ and $\\hat{c}_{j}^\\dagger$, as defined in the previous section, anti-commute but this combination of Pauli matrices do not.  This can be remedied by noting that the Pauli matrices naturally anti-commute by $XZ = -ZX$ and $YZ = -ZY$.  Interspersing $Z$ operators into the construction will thus emulate the anti-commutation needed which is shown as follows\n",

    "    \\hat{c}_{1}^\\dagger &= \\left(\\frac{X_1-iY_1}{2}\\right)\\otimes 1 \\otimes 1 \\otimes ... \\otimes 1  \\nonumber \\\\\n",
    "    \\hat{c}_{2}^\\dagger &= Z_1 \\otimes \\left(\\frac{X_2-iY_2}{2}\\right)\\otimes 1 \\otimes 1 \\otimes ... \\otimes 1 \\nonumber \\\\\n",
