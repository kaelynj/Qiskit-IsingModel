# Qiskit-IsingModel
A collaboration to work on mapping the Ising model to qiskit and the quantum computer's accessible through the IBM-Q experience.
Collaborators are:
  -Bruna
  -Matt
  -Kaelyn
  
Together we will simulate a simple 1d Ising system in Qiskit to learn more about how to use these open-source packages.
